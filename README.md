Why ff0?
========
ff0-tools (forty-eighty-tools) came about while looking for a short, easy to pronounce name for this project.
I was looking for a short name/domain combo and though why not using something geeky, like encoding?
ff0 seems to fit the geeky nature of the projects content.

Why git-hub?
============
Easy to use, powerful, free, collaborative source control :)
