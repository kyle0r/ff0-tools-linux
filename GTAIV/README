The problem
-----
Due to the inconsistent whitespacing in the handling.dat file, after edits or adding custom cars etc, it can be very hard to quicky visually compare two cars handling settings.
Personally, I feel this hinders finding good settings and makes the process very time consumping, and poentially lowers the overall quality of custom car releases.
I personally also find it very frustrating to make edits to cars when I can't compare handling lines easily.

The train of thought was: "I'm tweaking or making car X, its a bit like car Y. So how does car Y do it?"

The solution
-----
Once a handling.dat has been formatted by this script, all handling lines will be formatted in human friendly format.
This should make edits much easier, along with seeing what another car has for a certain value, as a reference when making tweaks.
Visual diff tools will also be much more useful for comparing before and after changes when both files have been formatted with this script.

Misc.
-----
I have tested this under Windows CYGWIN_NT-6.1-WOW64 version 1.7.15
